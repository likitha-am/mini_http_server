## Mini HTTP Server (C)

## Project Overview

Mini HTTP Server is a lightweight HTTP server implemented in C using low-level socket programming. The project demonstrates how a basic web server works, including handling client connections, processing HTTP requests, and sending HTTP responses.

This project is designed for learning purposes and helps in understanding core networking concepts such as TCP/IP communication, sockets, and request–response architecture.
